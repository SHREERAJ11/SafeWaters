# User Interface

## Overview
This repository contains the user interface (UI) for our disaster recovery solution. The UI is designed as a mobile application using Figma. It provides users with access to disaster-related information, sign-up functionality, and verification processes. Additionally, it includes a splash screen to showcase updates and highlight different types of disasters.
